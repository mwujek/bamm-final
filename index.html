				<p><span class="bold">The Problem: </span>Licensing recorded music is extremely complicated, expensive and doesn't scale. Multiple licenses are often required, and the rights may be held by a complicated mixture of labels, publishers, and individuals.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Our Solution: </span>>BAMM.tv doesn't license studio recordings; instead, we curate and produce live performances of songs at no cost to artists in exchange for a global, perpetual license. All of our content (including documentaries, podcasts, and music culture programming) is produced under the same license, making it simple for us to grant you a license to all or customized portions of the library.</p>

BAMM.tv is a curator of breaking artists, and we make content your customers will want to introduce to their friends. We are the taste-makers for the taste-makers.</p>

					<h1 class="slide-title">Typhoon</h1>
					<p>While it's likely you haven't heard of Typhoon, the band's story is a perfect example of BAMM.tv connecting with talented artists before they become more widely known. Back in 2011, BAMM.tv caught wind of a band getting some attention in Portland, Oregon, and immediately fell in love. Since shooting a live performance at the legendary music fesitval - South by Southwest - word of the the band spread nationally throughout the U.S. Typoon made its television debut on Late Night with David Letterman, opened for The Shins and The Decembrists, and has its music featured on television shows for NBC and the SciFy Newtwork. The band has recieved critical acclaim from the likes of NPR, Spin, KEXP, The Wall Street Journal, Entertainment Weekly.</p>

					<h1 class="slide-title">La Santa Cecilia</h1>
					<p>The momentum behind La Santa Cecilia can't be denied. Most recently, the band won a Grammy for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album and collaborated with Elvis Costello on "Losing Game". La Santa Cecilia's music has been featured on the Emmy award-winning series Weeds, the independent feature Dish, and the documentary Re-Encounters about Oaxacan artist Alejandro Santiago. Add to that an on-camera appearance on HBO's Emmy award-winning hit show Entourage (the episode also featured the songs "Chicle" and "El Farol"). While the band is now signed to a major label, BAMM.tv saw their potential early and shot a studio session with them in 2012, complete with an interview and 7 performance videos. La Santa Cecilia's videos have accumulated over 1.2 million views on Youtube alone</p>

					<h1 class="slide-title">The Flashbulb</h1>
					<p>The Flashbulb Benn Jordan is a great example of how traditional metrics no longer tell the entire story when it comes to music popularity. London International Award winner and a Cannes Grand Prix recipient, Jordan has taken a non-traditional route to a successful music career. As his works as a television and film composer earned him wider recognition, his personal projects increased in popularity. All the way back in 2008, Jordan made news by releasing (italicize album title) Soundtrack to a Vacant Life on BitTorrent (at the time, BitTorrent was a P2P file-sharing site), essentailly giving fans the album for free while directing them on how to make financial contribututions. The experiment paid off. In addition to supporting other artsits through Alphabasic - a non-profit record label where 100% of profit goes directly to the artists - Jordan's music continues to be some most widely ripped and shared music online.</p>

					<h1 class="slide-title">What about Justin Beiber or Ariana Grande?</h1>
					<p>We don't have it, and you don't want it. Most major label content is too expensive for us, and it's too expensive for you. What's more, that content is already on nearly every platform known to man, so it won't differentiate your brand. BAMM.tv's artists are breaking, affordable, and the content can't be found on any other platform.</p>

					<a data-featherlight="#video" class="lightbox-targetlink" href="#"><img src="img/artists4.png" class="lightbox-target"></a>
					<p>In an effort to produce performances that stand out from the endless stream of music videos posted online, BAMM.tv takes artists out of their traditional setting. To Go Show videos most often involve one continuous shot of the performer, and look to highlight a live performance taking place in an unusual, striking setting. This approach has been made popular by Vincent Moon of La Blogotheque, as well as other production companies. Artists are keen to really push these videos, too, because the performance is typically very different from the album version of the track. </p>

We opened our space for musicians to record and rehearse as we developed a workflow for producing broadcast-quality music videos on the cheap. With the proof of concept under our belt, we moved to a private venue in San Francisco's warehouse district and opened offices in London and Amsterdam. Over the years, we have recorded hundreds of artists in our in-house studio and at venues around the world.</p>
